# Fullstack Technical Test - ContactBook-App

## Specifications

- We want a React + Ruby on Rails application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts.  
- Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email, and phone number. 
- All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email.  
- The contacts will be persisted in the database.

## Technologies

- React JS (Frontend)
- Ruby on Rails (Backend)
